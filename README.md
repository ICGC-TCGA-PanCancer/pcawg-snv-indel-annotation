# pcawg-snv-indel-annotation

This repository hosts the PCAWG Annotator as a CWL workflow.

The Anntoator was created by Jonathan Dursi. For more information, see this repo: https://github.com/ljdursi/sga-annotate-docker

The original SeqWare workflow can be found here: https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/OxoGWrapperWorkflow
The Seqware workflow runs: the OxoG filter, produces mini-bams, and also runs Jonathan Dursi's PCAWG Annotator.

To visualize _this_ workflow, see here: https://view.commonwl.org/workflows/github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/pcawg-snv-indel-annotation/blob/develop/pcawg_annotate_wf.cwl
